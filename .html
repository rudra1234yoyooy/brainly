<p>The environment is the ecosystem of nature in which all living organisms survive together. They are dependent on each other for survival. When one creature is disturbed, the whole cycle gets eroded. This ecosystem comprises creatures such as human beings, plants, and animals. They are all living things. Non-living things such as rocks and minerals also play a crucial role in the functioning of the environment.The environment is the circumstance in which all-natural resources of earth adapt to live. Humans, animals, trees, oceans, rocks are the natural resources of the earth and together create an environment. They are responsible to provide living conditions for an organism. The environment is categorized into physical and biological. The first category includes atmosphere (air), hydrosphere (water), and lithosphere (solid). The second category involves all living beings such as human beings. Both of these categories are required together for the survival of life on earth. There will be no chance of survival on earth in the absence of any of these categories.The surroundings in which life exists on earth are called the environment. The environment contains air, water, sunlight, trees, animals, and human beings. They are the living and non-living creatures of the earth. The trees, human- beings, and animals are living organisms. The sun, water, and air are non-living organisms that are crucial for man’s survival. Every creature is a natural resource for each other. For example, deer is a natural resource to be eaten by a lion. Life on the earth would not be able to exist in the absence of any one of these natural resources.
However, the environment has components of the atmosphere and hydrosphere that influence the life of living beings. Gases such as nitrogen and oxygen are present in the atmosphere. Hydrosphere covers all the water bodies every living being is created according to the features of these components. For example, aquatic animals are created to breathe underwater. Aerial animals are made to breathe in air. </P>



<p>The environment is the natural surroundings of the earth that enables an organism’s survival. The French word ‘environ’ that means to surround is a derivative of the word environment. It consists of living beings such as humans, plants, and animals. The air, water, and land are non-living entities. Their functioning is designed by nature in such a way that everything is dependent on each other. The human being is the most dominant creature of all the beings who can depend on all the natural resources of the earth. He requires the air to breathe. Not only humans but plants and animals also need air to breathe. There will be no life on earth without air. It is only the human being who is responsible for the destruction of the environment.

The environment is divided into different layers such as atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, and biosphere. The atmosphere is made up of several gases such as nitrogen and oxygen. All the water bodies make up the hydrosphere. The lithosphere is the covering of the earth that is made up of rock and soil. Life exists in the biosphere.The earth consists of surroundings in which all living and non-living beings live their lives. The physical, biological, and natural forces of nature combine together and create circumstances that enable an organism to live. Such circumstances are called the environment. The French word ‘environ’ which means to surround is a derivative of the word environment.

All the biotic (living) and abiotic (non-living) entities constitute the environment. Biotic things include- humans, plants, animals, and insects. They are classified as biological components of the environment. Every biotic creature has its own fixed life cycle. For example, human-being is the strongest living organism on earth. He needs plants and animals in order to fulfill his needs. His life-cycle will be disorganized without them.

Whereas, abiotic components involve the atmosphere, lithosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere. They are the layers of the environment. These layers are categorized as physical components of the environment. The atmosphere is the layer of air made up of nitrogen, oxygen, and other gases. All the water bodies such as rivers and oceans together make up the hydrosphere.</p>



<h3><u>TYPES OF ENVIERMENT ARE NATURAL ENVIERMENT AND MANMADE ENVIERMENT</u></h3>

<p>When Riya was on the way home from school one day, she heard some people nearby talking. One of them said,” It is so sad seeing our natural environment change. All the trees will be cut down.” Riya quickly looked at her mother and asked, ” What is a natural environment, mother?”. “Everything around us that is not human-made is our natural environment”, said her mother. Riya was confused. Let’s help Riya understand what natural and human-made environments are.







<h4><u>NATURAL ENVIERMENT</u><h4>

<p>Natural Environment
Everything that is not human-made comes under natural environment. Land, air, water, plants and animals all comprise the natural environment. Let us learn about the different domains of the natural environment. These are the lithosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere and biosphereThe lithosphere is the solid crust or the hard top layer of the earth. It is made up of rocks and minerals and covered with a thin layer of soil. The lithosphere is an irregular surface with mountains, plateaus, plains, valleys, landforms, etc. It is the domain that provides us with forests, grasslands for grazing, land for agriculture and housing. It is also a source of minerals.
Hydrosphere is the domain of water. It comprises of the various sources of water and different types of water bodies like rivers, lakes, seas, oceans, estuaries, etc. It is essential for all living organisms.
The atmosphere is the thin layer of air that surrounds the earth. It is held by the gravitational force of the earth. The Atmosphere protects us from the harmful UV rays from the sun by blocking them out. It contains a number of gases like oxygen, which is essential for life, dust and water vapour. Changes in atmosphere bring changes in weather and climate.
All life makes up the biosphere. It is the zone of the earth where land, water and air interact with each other to support life.



<h5><u>HUMAN MADE ENVIERMENT</u></h5>

<p>Human environment is the man-made environment. It has been modified by humans according to their needs. Before technology evolved, human beings would adapt themselves to the natural environment. They led a simple life and fulfilled their requirements from the nature around them. With time, their needs grew and became more varied. Human learnt new ways to change their environment according to their needs.

They learnt to grow crops, domesticate animals and build houses. They invented the wheel, barter system, trade and commerce. Transportation became faster. Large-scale production was possible through Industrial revolution. Communication became easier and speedy across the world. They have formed an artificial ecosystem.

A perfect balance is necessary between the natural and man-made environment. If we use the sources provided by environment wisely, we can establish a healthy balance. We should use our resources wisely and learn to conserve them. natural resources like wood, minerals, water, air are precious and essential for survival. If we do not use them wisely, we may run out of them one day. We should think about our future generations.

<h6><u>THERE ARE SOME SOLVED QUESTON FOR YOU</u></h6>


<p>Q: Which is not a natural ecosystem?

a) desert          b) aquarium         c) forest

Solution: b)aquarium. An aquarium is a man-made ecosystem


<p>Question 2.
What all are the part of our environment?
Answer:
Our Surroundings constitute environment. Buildings furniture like tables, chairs, open field, road, garbage etc. are all part of our environment. Some things like mountains, rivers, trees are created by nature. Others like chair, table, roads and clothes are made by man.</p>

<p>Question 3.
Why is our environment changing?
Answer:

It is all because of our needs.
They are increasing day by day.
We are therefore modifying and at times even destroying our natural surroundings.</p>


Question 4.
How do human beings modify the environment?
Answer:
Environment provides the basic life support system like air, water, food and land. The man made things like car pollute the air, factories build on land, containers for food and water are the examples of modification of environment
